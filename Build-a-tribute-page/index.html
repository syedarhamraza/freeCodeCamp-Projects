          Muhammad Ali Jinnah (born Mahomedali Jinnahbhai; 25 December 1876 – 11
          September 1948) was a barrister, politician, and the founder of
          Pakistan. Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India Muslim League
          from 1913 until the inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, and then
          as the Republic of Pakistan's first governor-general until his death.

          Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at
          Lincoln's Inn in London, England. Upon his return to India, he
          enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national
          politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to
          prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first two decades of
          the 20th century. In these early years of his political career, Jinnah
          advocated Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact
          between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah
          had also become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the All-India
          Home Rule League, and proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform
          plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims in the Indian
          subcontinent. In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when
          it agreed to follow a campaign of satyagraha, which he regarded as
          political anarchy.

        <p id="tribute-info-description">
          By 1940, Jinnah had come to believe that the Muslims of the
          subcontinent should have their own state to avoid the possible
          marginalised status they might be reduced to in an independent
          Hindu–Muslim state. In that year, the Muslim League, led by Jinnah,
          passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding a separate nation for Indian
          Muslims. During the Second World War, the League gained strength while
          leaders of the Congress were imprisoned, and in the provincial
          elections held shortly after the war, it won most of the seats
          reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League
          could not reach a power-sharing formula that would allow the entirety
          of British India to be united as a single state following
          independence, leading all parties to agree instead to the independence
          of a Hindu-majority India, and for a predominantly Muslim state of
          Pakistan.

          As the first governor-general of Pakistan, Jinnah worked to establish
          the new nation's government and policies, and to aid the millions of
          Muslim migrants who had emigrated from neighbouring India to Pakistan
          after the two states' independence, personally supervising the
          establishment of refugee camps. Jinnah died at age 71 in September
          1948, just over a year after Pakistan gained independence from the
          United Kingdom. He left a deep and respected legacy in Pakistan.
          Several universities and public buildings in Pakistan bear Jinnah's
          name. He is revered in Pakistan as the Quaid-e-Azam ("Great Leader")
          and Baba-e-Qaum ("Father of the Nation"). His birthday is also
          observed as a national holiday in the country. According to his
          biographer, Stanley Wolpert, Jinnah remains Pakistan's greatest
          leader.
